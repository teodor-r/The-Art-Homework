\section{Planning the industrial research project}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Goal of the project is a new credit scoring model or modified past one in accordance with current realities.
\item Which factors  are most likely to  contribute to the final score now. The results will be taken into account in the bank's loan issuance policy.
\item We need data from the period when the accuracy of the previous model was no longer acceptable. The data structure is all kinds of information about a potential borrower we got in past and probably new features required during the research.
\item If logistic regression is chosen as the model, we will optimize log-likelihood.
\item To build a stochastic model based on logistic regression and show the probability of default under a particular loan policy.
\item Relevant data set.
\item Logistic regression, time series
\end{enumerate}
